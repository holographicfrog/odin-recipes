    <img src="/home/jersh/odin-recipes/img/parmesanchicken.jpg">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (10 oz each) boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (2.5 oz) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup (2.5 oz) panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (1.5 oz) finely shredded parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>6 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges and fresh parsley (optional), for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Butterfly and split each chicken breasts into two portions, making four pieces total. Cover chicken with plastic wrap and pound each piece to an even 1/4-inch thickness with the flat side of a meat mallet.</li>
        <li>In one shallow dish add flour, Italian seasoning and garlic powder and whisk to blend.</li>
        <li>In a second shallow dish whisk eggs together until blended.</li>
        <li>In a third shallow dish toss together panko and parmesan.</li>
        <li>Season chicken cutlets with salt and pepper on each side. Then working with one at a time dredge both sides in flour mixture, transfer to eggs and dredge both sides, lift and let excess run of.</li>
        <li>Transfer to panko mixture, coat both sides while pressing mixture in to coat well.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 cup olive in a 12-inch heavy non-stick skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add two breasts to preheated skillet and let cook until golden brown on bottom, about 4 minutes (if needed reduce burner temperature slightly if you find it's browning too quickly). Flip and continue to cook until golden brown on bottom and center registers 165 degrees on an instant read thermometer, about 4 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain, leaving oil in skillet. Add remaining 2 Tbsp oil to skillet and repeat cooking process with remaining two chicken breasts.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with lemon wedges and garnished with parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
