    <p>Delicious, classic American cookies</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/3 cup (188g) all-purpose flour (scoop and level to measure)</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>    
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>   
        <li>1/2 cup (113g) unsalted butter, softened</li>    
        <li>1/2 cup (105g) granulated sugar</li>    
        <li>1/2 cup (110g) packed light brown sugar</li>    
        <li>3/4 cup (185g) creamy peanut butter</li>    
        <li>1 large egg</li>    
        <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>    
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Line two 18 by 13-inch baking sheets with silicone baking liners or parchment paper.</li>  
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment cream together butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until combined.</li>
        <li>Mix in peanut butter then blend in egg and vanilla. With mixer set on low speed slowly add in flour mixture and mix just until combined.</li>
        <li>Scoop dough out and shape into balls (30 grams each or nearly 2 Tbsp) then place on baking sheets spacing them 2-inches apart.</li>
        <li>Using a long pronged fork flatten cookies slightly then turn fork going opposite direction and flatten just slightly again (it should create that criss cross pattern).</li>
        <li>Bake cookies in preheated oven, one sheet at a time, for about 9 minutes (cookies will appear pale and slightly under-baked, they'll continue to cook slightly as they cool). </li>
        <li>Let cool on baking sheet 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store cookies and an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
